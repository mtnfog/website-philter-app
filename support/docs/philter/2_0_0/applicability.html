title: Philter Documentation - Applicability to PHI, PII, and NPPI
layout: documentation
types:
  - number: 1
    type: Person's Names
    example: John Smith, Jane Doe
    how:
      - Philter identifies names in natural language text using state of the art machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to identify named-person entities
      - Philter also uses common first name and surname dictionaries with spellcheck capability to identify common names per the US census.
  - number: 2
    type: Geographic Identifiers
    summary: All geographical identifiers smaller than a state, except for the initial three digits of a zip code if, according to the current publicly available data from the US. Bureau of the Census - the geographic unit formed by combining all zip codes with the same three initial digits contains more than 20,000 people; and the initial three digits of a zip code for all such geographic units containing 20,000 or fewer people is changed to 000.
    example: 85055, 90213-1544
    how:
      - Philter can identify many US cities, US counties, and all US states (full names and abbreviations).
      - Philter uses a dictionary with spelling correction to identify misspelled locations.
      - Filter conditions in filter profiles can be used to apply logic based on zip code population according to the US census. (Filter strategies can truncate the zip code.)
      - Philter also uses state of the art machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to identify locations.
      - Philter includes a dictionary of some hospital locations to quickly identify medical locations.
  - number: 3

				<h2 class="documentation-header">Applicability to PHI and PII</h2>
				<p>Philter has many predefined types of sensitive information that can be identified. The individual types are described below.</p>
				<p>Personally identifiable information (PII) is any information that could potentially be used to identify a specific person.</p>
				<p>Protected health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to an individual. The Health Insurance Portability And Accountability Act (HIPAA) defines 18 types of PHI.</p>

				<h3>Predefined Types of PII and PHI</h3>
				<p>The types of sensitive information that Philter will identify is customizable. For example, if you are not interested in VIN numbers you can have Philter ignore them. This configuration is performed through <a href="/filter-profiles/">Filter Profiles</a>.</p>
				<p>Because Philter only operates on text, the biometric identifiers and face images outlined in the HIPAA regulations as PHI are not applicable to Philter. The types of sensitive information and how Philter identifies each one is listed in the table below.</p>
