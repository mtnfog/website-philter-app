		</ul>

		<h3>Version 1.9.0 – January 21, 2021</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>New: Added support for filtering PDF documents.
			<li>New: Added support for two-way SSL/TLS authentication and removed API token authentication.

			<li>Fix: Fixed an issue with custom dictionary filters where the terms may be read and loaded incorrectly.
			<li>Fix: Fixed an issue where the surname filter may not produce any results.
		</ul>

		<h3>Version 1.8.0 – November 5, 2020</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>New: Adding metric capture for execution time of each filter. These timing metrics can help assist with improving performance for filters.
			<li>New: Added ability to read lists of ignored terms from files for each filter type.
		</ul>

		<h3>Version 1.7.0 – October 4, 2020</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>New: Added metrics reporting for Prometheus.
			<li>New: Added an experimental feature to accommodate requests to filter long text. We are looking for feedback on this initial functionality.  The new feature, when enabled, will split text into pieces based on new lines. The pieces are then processed and reassembled prior to being returned. Because of the splitting, the reassembled text will likely not be an exact match of the input text due to white space differences. If maintaining the format of the input text through the filtering process is important to you then the best course of action is to handle the splitting client side so you have control over it.
			<li>New: Terms can now be ignored based on regular expression patterns. Previously Philter had the ability to ignore specified terms but the terms had to match exactly. Now you can specify terms to ignore via regular expression patterns. An example use of this new feature is to ignore non-sensitive information that can change such as timestamps in log messages.
			<li>New: Added ability to read ignored terms from files outside of the filter profile.
			<li>New: Custom dictionary terms can now be phrases or multi-term keywords.
			<li>New: Added “classification” condition to Identifier filter to allow for writing conditionals against the classification value.
			<li>New: Added configurable timeout values to allow for modifying timeouts of internal Philter communication. This can help when processing larger amounts of text. See the Settings for more information.
			<li>New: Added option to IBAN Code filter to allow spaces in the IBAN codes.
			<li>New: Ignore lists for individual filters are no longer case-sensitive. (“John” will be ignored for “JOHN.”)
			<li>Fix: Fixed IBAN Code validation to fix issue where sometimes an invalid IBAN Code would validate.
			<li>Fix: Changes to improve performance when handling long input text.
			<li>Tweak: Updated base AWS AMI.
			<li>Tweak: Updated base Docker container to UBI 8.2.
			<li>Tweak: Reduced AWS EBS image size to 8 GB.
		</ul>

		<h3>Version 1.6.1.3 – August 31, 2020</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Updated the base image.
		</ul>

		<h3>Version 1.6.1.2 – August 24, 2020</h3>

		This version (1.6.1.2) of Philter will only be available on the AWS Marketplace.

		<ul>
			<li>Updated the base image.
		</ul>

		<h3>Version 1.6.1.1 – July 29, 2020</h3>

		</ul>

		<h3>Version 1.6.1 – July 8, 2020</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Updated the Microsoft Azure base OS from CentOS 7.7 to CentOS 8.2.
		</ul>

		<h3>Version 1.6.0 – June 9, 2020</h3>

		Release Announcement Post

		Version 1.6.0 brings many new features and enhancements. Some of these changes may impact your existing filter profiles. Please contact us for assistance if you encounter any difficulties adapting your filter profile for 1.6.0.

		<ul>
			<li>New: Added ability to generate alerts when a filter strategy condition is met. Generated alerts are available through Philter’s API. Use alerts to trigger when certain sensitive information, such as a name, is identified.
			<li>New: Added a “span disambiguation” feature that disambiguates identified sensitive information for identical text. For example, if the text “123456789” is identified both as a phone number and an SSN, the span disambiguation will determine whether “123456789” more closely resembles a phone number or an SSN based on previously filtered text. The feature is optional and is disabled by default. Learn more about it in the User’s Guide.
			<li>New: Philter configuration properties can be set through environment variables.
			<li>New: Added Bitcoin address filter.
			<li>New: Added IBAN code filter.
			<li>New: Added tracking number filter for FedEx, UPS, and USPS.
			<li>New: Added a new replacement strategy to replace sensitive information with its SHA-256 hash value.
			<li>New: Added support for connecting to a Redis cache with a self-signed SSL certificate.
			<li>New: Added filter condition for “classification.” A classification can be an entity type such as “PER” for person, or it can be a passport country such as “US”, or a state for a driver’s license such as “CA”. A classification is to give a more granular description of some sensitive information.
			<li>New: Added “fuzzy” property to custom dictionary filter. When set to “true”, the filter will allow for searching for loose matching. When set to false, terms must appear as listed in the dictionary. Most cases will see a significant performance improvement when setting to “fuzzy” to false when not needed.
			<li>New: Added “files” property to custom dictionary filter. Now you can list custom dictionary terms in a file outside of the filter profile. This property is a list meaning you can specify multiple files. You must provide the full path to the file on the local file system.
			<li>Tweak: Changed “type” to “classification” for filters in a filter profile.
			<li>Fix: Fixed issue where MAC address filter strategies may not be loaded correctly.
			<li>Fix: Fixed issue where custom dictionary terms that are set to be ignored may not be ignored correctly.
			<li>Fix: Fixed issue where valid credit card numbers may be determined to be invalid. (Only affects when the credit card filter has verification enabled.)
		</ul>

		<h3>Version 1.5.2 – May 20, 2020</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>There were no feature changes for this version and no need to upgrade from 1.5.0.
			<li>The changes were to allow Philter to be available as Docker containers.

		<ul>
			<li>New: Added new filter called “Section” to identify text between two markers.
			<li>New: Added ability to use custom NLP models.

		</ul>

		<h3>Version 1.4.0 – April 10, 2020</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>New: Added optional basic authentication.

		</ul>

		<h3>Version 1.3.1 – February 20, 2020</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>New: Added CRYPTO_REPLACE redaction option to encrypt sensitive values.
			<li>New: Added %v redaction variable to be substituted for the original value of the sensitive text. With %v you can now annotate sensitive information instead of masking or removing it.

			<li>New: Added support for TINs (Tax Identification Numbers) to the SSN filter.
			<li>New: Now requires Java 11.

			<li>Tweak: GCP image is now built on CentOS 8.
			<li>Tweak: Credit card filter now supports credit card numbers containing dashes and spaces.

			<li>New: Added enabled property to individual filters in a filter profile. Filters having enabled=false will not be executed.
			<li>New: Added option to filter profile credit cards to also include invalid credit card numbers. (Credit card numbers that match the pattern but are not valid per the card’s number algorithm.)
			<li>New: Added option to filter profile to require dates be valid dates. (The date February 30 is not a valid date and would be excluded when enabled.)
			<li>New: Added option to filter profile for NER to remove punctuation prior to processing.
